  When   user calls entries method with valid request and with the name of this repository
  Then   user receives all values with their keys from the repository

Scenario: fetch() should return value by key

  When   user calls fetch method with key:X and the name of this repository
  Then   user receives the key:X with its value from the repository

 Scenario: save() should persist value by key
