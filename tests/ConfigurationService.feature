# 'configurationService' configuration is built into the local storage from remote service with configKey, defaultValues
Scenario: 'configKey' receive 'localStorageKey' and builds the configurationService local storage
  Given   configurationService with buildConfigurationServiceLocalStorage method
  And     user sends createConfigurationService request
  Then    buildConfigurationServiceLocalStorage response will be received
  And     buildConfigurationServiceLocalStorage (configKey, defaultValues)

# The method 'deleteAll' provides the deletion of all configuration keys, return empty promise
Scenario: If a valid 'deleteAll' is sent then a response received is rejected or passed
  Given   configurationService with deleteAll method
  And     there are configuration keys in local storage
  When    user sends a valid deleteAll request (default values{numValue: 1, stringValue: 'test'})
  And     request is valid
  Then    user received 'resolved' promise
  And     all configuration keys removed

# DELETE THIS, IRRELEVANT SINCE THIS IS NOT A SERVER REQUEST
Scenario: A 'deleteAll' is sent and no response is received due to server or network error
  Given   configurationService with deleteAll method
  And     keys array in local storage has configuration values
  When    user sends a valid deleteAll request
  And     network or server error
  Then    a relevant error message will be presented
  And     hub will continue to run

# REMOVE, THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS TO THIS
Scenario: Validating the 'deleteAll' method values
  Given   configurationService with deleteAll method
  When    user sends a deleteAll request (default values{numValue: 1, stringValue: 'test'})
  Then    user received 'resolved' promise

# The method 'deleteKey' provides the deletion of configuration by specific key, return empty promise
Scenario: If a 'deleteKey' is sent then a response received is rejected or passed
  Given   configurationService with deleteKey method
  And     configKey:X exists in local storage
  When    user sends a valid deleteKey request (configKey:X)
  Then    user received 'resolved' promise
  And     configKey:X was removed from local storage

# To be used in the future when this logic wil be implemented.
Scenario: If a 'deleteKey' is sent with a non exist key, an error will be received
  Given   configurationService with deleteKey method
  And     configKey:X exists in local storage
  When    user sends a deleteKey request
  And     configKey:X sent does not exist
  Then    rejected response will be received
  And     error(`Configuration key ${configKey} not found`)

# REMOVE, NOT SERVER REQUEST
Scenario: A 'deleteKey' is sent and no response is received due to server or network error
  Given   configurationService with deleteKey method
  When    user sends a valid deleteKey request
  And     network or server error
  Then    a relevant error message will be presented
  And     hub will continue to run

# REMOVE, NO LOGIC IS USED HERE
Scenario: Validating the request from a 'deleteKey' method
  Given   configurationService with deleteKey method
  When    user sends a valid deleteKey request
  And     response that was given was not a rejected or passed
  Then    a relevant error will be presented

# The method 'get' provides the configuration by specific key, return promise with configuration object
Scenario: 'get' method is used for a specific key, return configuration received
  Given   configurationService with get method
  And     provider has the configuration for key:X
  When    user sends a valid 'get' request with (key:X)
  Then    user receives a correct response for key:X

Scenario: 'get' method is sent with a non exist key, a rejection message "Configuration key aKey not found" will be received
  Given   configurationService with get method
  And     provider is local storage doesn't have the configuration for key:Z
  When    user sends a 'get' request with key:Z
  Then    an error message "Configuration key key:Z not found" will be received

# REMOVE, NO LOGIC IS USED HERE
Scenario: Validating the 'get' request value (string)
  Given   configurationService with get method
  And     provider is local storage
  When    user sends an in valid 'get' request with <numValue>, <stringValue>
  |numValue	|stringValue	|
  |!(string)|!(string)		|
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# The method 'keys' provides the list of configuration keys, return promise string array
Scenario: 'keys' method is used by ConfigurationService instance to send configurations for all keys, an array of configurations received
  Given   configurationService with keys method
  And     configuration service has several configuration keys
  When    user sends a valid keys request
  Then    user receives array of strings of the keys configuration

# REMOVE, THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS TO THE REQUEST
Scenario: 'keys' method is used by ConfigurationService to send a non exist value, an error will be presented
  Given   configurationService with keys method
  When    user sends a non exist keys request (configKey + '9999')
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# REMOVE, THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS TO THE REQUEST
Scenario: Validating the 'keys' return value (string)
  Given   configurationService with keys method
  When    user sends an invalid 'keys' request with <configKey> <numValue>, <stringValue>
  |configKey  |numValue |stringValue	|
  |!(string)  |!(string)|!(string)		|
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# The method 'set' provides the setting of configuration by specific key, return empty promise
Scenario: 'set' method is used to send a specific key configuration
  Given   configurationService with set method
  And     provider has configuration for key:9999
  When    user sends a valid 'set' request with (key:9999, value:T)
  Then    configuration for key:9999 was updated with value:T

Scenario: 'set' method is used by ConfigurationService to send a non exist key, an error will be presented
  Given   configurationService with set method
  And     provider doesn't have key:10000 configuration
  When    user sends a non exist 'set' value (key:10000, value:T)
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# To be used in the future when this logic wil be implemented.
Scenario: Validating the 'set' request value for a specific key (string)
  Given   configurationService with set method
  When    user sends an invalid 'set' request with <configKey> <numValue>, <stringValue>
  |Key        |Value    |
  |!(string)  |!(string)|
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# The method 'values' provides the getting of configurations by specific key, return promise with array of configuration objects by all keys
Scenario: 'values' method is used to get the configuration of a specific key, response received is an array of configurations by all keys
  Given   configurationService with values method
  And     provider has several configured keys
  And     key (value:a, key:b)
  When    user sends a valid 'values' request with (value:a, key:b)
  Then    array of configuration objects for all values received

Scenario: 'values' method is used by ConfigurationService to send a non exist value of a specific key, an error will be presented
  Given   configurationService with values method
  And     provider has several configured keys
  And     key (value:XXX, key:b) does not exist
  When    user sends an invalid 'values' request with (value:XXX, key:b)
  Then    a relevant error will be received

# To be used in the future when this logic wil be implemented.
Scenario: Validating the 'values' request of the array
  Given   configurationService with values method
  And     provider has several configured keys
  When    user sends an invalid 'values' request with <configKey> <numValue>, <stringValue>
  |Key        |Value    |
  |!(string)  |!(string)|
  Then    a relevant error will be received
